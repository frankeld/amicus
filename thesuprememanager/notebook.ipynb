The Board granted him an annuity, but Salinas appealed the annuity&#39;s beginning date and amount. During that appeal, Salinas asked the Board to reopen all its decisions on his prior applications, including the decision denying his 2006 application. After a hearing, a Board hearing officer concluded that Salinas&#39;s 2006 application was beyond the four-year timeframe for reopening based on new and material evidence or administrative error under the Board&#39;s regulations. Salinas then asked the U.S. Court of Appeals to review the Board&#39;s decision not to reopen his 2006 application. Following its own binding precedent holding that it lacked jurisdiction to review a Board decision declining to reopen a prior benefits claim, the Fifth Circuit dismissed Salinas’s petition.\\n&quot;}, {&#39;title&#39;: &#39;Torres v.

Unbeknownst to Van Buren, Albo recorded the conversation in which Van Buren requested the loan.
